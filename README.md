## Technologies Used

* C#
* .NET
* ASP.NET MVC

## Description

This application presents users with a Home page where they can create a list of places that they have traveled to. Users can enter the city, country, length of stay, a journal entry, and who they traveled with. They submit a form which adds the place to a list of places that can be continuously updated. Users can view a list of all the places they have visited, and then select each place to view the details of each trip. They can also clear the list of places they created and start over.

## Setup Instructions

1. Select the green button that says `Code`, and clone this repository to your desktop.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to this project's production directory called `PlacesVisited`.
3. In the command line, run the command `dotnet watch run` to launch the project in development mode with a watcher.
4. To run tests for the `Place` class, navigate to this project's directory called `PlacesVisited.Tests` and run the command `dotnet test` to test the class.

## Known Bugs

Application is functioning fully as intended. I plan to add CSS styling to it later.
